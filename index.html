    	<H4>Friends Russell and Booker Return to USA Camp as Participants</H4><p>Four years ago, D'Angelo Russell and Devin Booker stood on this same court, watching off to the side while dressed in matching blue polos and white shorts.</p>

		<p>Now, they wear "USA" across their chests as they compete on the UNLV hardwood against some of the best players in the world.</p>

		<p>In 2012, Russell and Booker were part of a group of high schoolers who were able to sit in on a U.S. National Team practice before it went off to London for the Olympics. This year, as members of the USA Select Team, the young guards were tasked with scrimmaging the current crop of American Olympians.</p>

		<p>"When we were here four years ago, we always knew that we'd be in this situation," Booker said. "Obviously I didn't know it'd be this early, but we're blessed and fortunate enough of the opportunity."</p>

		<p>Booker was just 15 at the time, but both he and Russell, then-16, were confident that they would someday be playing against the likes of Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, whom they watched with awe that day.</p>

		<p>"It was unbelievable just seeing the level they were on," Booker said. "I couldn't imagine just playing against them. Now it's crazy that I got the chance to play against Kobe and LeBron and everybody like that."</p>

		<p>Russell and Booker had actually met a year prior at the Nike Elite 100 Camp for some of the best high school players in the nation.</p>

		<p>What began as an on-court rivalry rapidly evolved into an off-the-floor friendship that lasts to this day.</p>

		<p>"We met each other at this camp and we dominated the camp," Russell said. "Every since then, everywhere we went we dominated together. Either he was on a different team or I was on a different team. You would hear his name somewhere and you would hear my name somewhere."</p>
